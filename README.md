# totalHeadloss2

This repository is an excercise in collaborating on engineering tools with Jared. 

coolingWaterSystem.py contains an example of how to use totalHeadloss.py.

totalHeadloss.py uses majorLosses.py, minorLosses.py, and internalFlowProperties.py to calculate the total head loss for a piping system.
